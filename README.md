# 👋 Hi, I’m Shuo Yang  

🔎 **Open to Work**  
Full-stack engineer with a background in architecture and urban design.  
Graduated with an **M.S. in Computer Science from Tufts University (GPA 3.92/4.0)**.  
I bring systematic design thinking from both physical and digital worlds to build scalable, user-centered software.

## 🌟 About Me  

I bring **three years of professional experience in the design industry**, working at a high-end design firm on forward-looking projects such as **smart cities, high-tech company headquarters, and future urban environments**. These projects engaged with concepts like **public realm design, autonomous transportation, robotic-embedded buildings, and data-driven planning**, which trained me to think systematically, collaborate across disciplines, and design with users and data at the center.  

This background continues to shape how I approach **software engineering**.  
To me, both architecture and engineering are about **designing systems**—one in the **physical world**, the other in the **abstract, digital world**. Both require **systematic thinking, structured problem-solving, and user-oriented design principles**. My experience creating physical spaces has strengthened the way I think about building abstract systems, and I now bring that mindset into my work as a **full-stack engineer**.
